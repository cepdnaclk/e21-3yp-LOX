## Introduction

### The Real World Problem

With the increase in urban mobility, online shopping, and public space usage, there is a
growing need for secure, flexible, and remotely accessible storage solutions. Traditional
lockers require physical keys and manual supervision, which limits usability and security.

### Solution
This project proposes a Smart Locker System integrated with a Mobile Application,
allowing users to reserve, access, and manage lockers remotely, while administrators
can monitor, control, and handle emergencies efficiently.

### Impact
The system is designed for deployment in public locations across Sri Lanka, such as bus
stations, railway stations, shopping malls, universities, and offices.
