# eYY-3yp-LOX

## Introduction

With the increase in urban mobility, online shopping, and public space usage, there is a
growing need for secure, flexible, and remotely accessible storage solutions. Traditional
lockers require physical keys and manual supervision, which limits usability and security.

This project proposes a Smart Locker System integrated with a Mobile Application,
allowing users to reserve, access, and manage lockers remotely, while administrators
can monitor, control, and handle emergencies efficiently.

The system is designed for deployment in public locations across Sri Lanka, such as bus
stations, railway stations, shopping malls, universities, and offices.
